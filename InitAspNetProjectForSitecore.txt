Prerequisites:
Visual Studio 2017 (.NET Framework 4.7.1) [Run as Admin]
Sitecore Version 9
Local Sitecore url: http://sc901.local/
Local Sitecore location: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\sc901\Website
Setup connection between Visual Studio and Sitecore (via Sitecore Rocks)

1. Create new project in VS: ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)
2. Select [Empty] Web Application
3. Remove web.config from main folder (this web.config will override default Sitecore's)
4. To folder bin (it is not included into solution) add Sitecore.Kernerl.dll and Sitecore.Mvc.dll (from your wwwroot)
5. Add project reference to those 2 dlls
5. Add folder 'Views'
6. Inside 'Views' folder add simple cshtml file (in my case: MyMvcLayout.cshtml)
6. Build project
7. Add publish profile (Folder -> deployed to IIS site that your sitecore is running on)
8. publish project and check if page works and has sample cshtml file inside Views folder in wwwroot

Next:
9. In Sitecore create new MVC layout under: /sitecore/layout/Layouts and point path to sample cshtml created previously
10. In any item under sitecore/content remove all rendering and change default layout to layout created in previous step
11. Open page in the browser (publish layout and item if needed)

* by default Sitecore displays content from Web database. To change it edit Sitecore.config file and for node: <site name="website" ... change database attribute from "web" to "master"

Shortcut:
Get solution that is already set (remember to include 2 Sitecore dlls mentioned before)
